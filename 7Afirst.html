			<b>Crayon-Shin chan </b>(Japanese: クレヨンしんちゃん, Hepburn: Kureyon Shin-chan), also known as Shin Chan, is a <b>Japanese manga series</b> written and illustrated by <b>Yoshito Usui.</b> It follows the adventures of the five-year-old Shinnosuke "Shin" Nohara and his parents, baby sister, dog, neighbours, and friends and is set in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture of Japan.

Crayon Shin-chan first appeared in 1990 in a Japanese weekly magazine called <b>Weekly Manga Action,</b> which was published by Futabasha. Due to the death of author Yoshito Usui, the manga in its original form ended on <b>September 11, 2009.</b> A new manga began in the summer of 2010 by members of Usui's team,[5] titled New Crayon Shin-chan (新クレヨンしんちゃん, Shin Kureyon Shin-chan).

An anime adaptation of the series began airing on <b>TV Asahi</b> in 1992 and is still ongoing on several television networks, worldwide. The show has now been dubbed in <b>30 languages</b> which aired in 45 countries, has over 1007 episodes and 26 full-length movies. More than <b>275 million copies</b> of the manga have been sold worldwide in 20 years.

An anime spin-off titled <b>Super Shiro,</b> produced by Science Saru, premiered in October 2019.[8] The story follows the Noharas' family dog, Shiro, becoming a superhero and protecting the legendary bone "Bobobobobone" from the evil inventor dog, Dekapoo and his ambitions of world domination

			<h2><u>Quick Review Of <strong>Shinchan</strong></h2></u>
			<p style="color:black;">
			So at first, I thought what a stupid cartoon. The anime is horrible, do they expect us to watch such an ugly cartoon. But all it took was one episode to make me feel so foolish. This cartoon is awesome, especially for a mature family to enjoy together. I don't watch it alone. I watch it with the entire family. It's a lot more fun that way. I fell in love with Misty's voice. She is amazing and all the characters are funny and play perfect roles. Yes, this cartoon isn't for everyone, but those that get it will adore it. Basically it's a very funny show that reveals the truth about being a parent. It's really good, give it a chance if one episode doesn't change your mind, then you're not missing out and probably are a child to not fully appreciate it's humor.</p>
